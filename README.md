# cijada
Cross-platform 2D Cellular Automaton graphical modelling application (CijadA), written entirely in C# on the .NET platform, developed on Linux using the Mono runtime, while maintaining cross-platform compatibility with MS Windows.

The application calculates next-generation cell values in realtime so that it's capable of running Conway's Life Game as well as other reproduction cellular automatons by Stanislaw Ulam.

(When it was first developed, it was nicknamed as "carpet generator" because of its sometimes symmetrical patterns. The name stands for the combination of Cellular Automaton and the Arabic word for carpet - Sijada.)

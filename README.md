# cijada
Cross-platform 2D Cellular Automaton graphical modelling application (CijadA), written entirely in C# on the .NET platform, developed on Linux using the Mono runtime, while maintaining cross-platform compatibility with MS Windows.

The application calculates next-generation cell values in realtime so that it's capable of running Conway's Life Game as well as other reproduction cellular automatons by Stanislaw Ulam.
